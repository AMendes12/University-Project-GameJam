# 🎮 One Time Use – Game Jam Project

Theme: One Time Use

Development Time: 24 hours

In this fast-paced action prototype, every decision matters — because every resource is truly one-time use.

If the player dies, the entire game must be closed and reopened before trying again. No retries. No second chances.

# 🧩 Core Mechanics
🩸 One Life Only

When you die, you must restart the application.

There is no respawn.

🔫 One Bullet Weapons

Every weapon has only one bullet.

After firing, the weapon becomes useless — you must drop it (F) and pick up another one (E).

🧗 Wall Ride

The player can slide along walls to maintain momentum and traverse levels creatively.

🪝 Grappling Gun

Use the grappling gun (Mouse 0) to swing, traverse gaps, and chain movement with wall rides and slides.
